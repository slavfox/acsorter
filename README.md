A dumb sorter for ACNH villagers.

Needs a Python 3 interpreter that works with Tk.

To use:
```console
$ ./get_villagers.py
$ mv villager_dump.json villagers.json
$ ./sort.py
$ ./show_results.py
```

If `sort.py` shows an error, just rerun it, I was too lazy to add error
 handling.

Progress is saved after each click.
